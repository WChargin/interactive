A <strong>standing wave</strong> is a physical phenomenon that can occur when two waves going in opposite directions overlap.
Under certain conditions, the resulting interference can create a wave that appears to stand still (hence the name).
Standing waves are often visualized as transverse waves, because this is easy to see.
However, standing longitudinal waves are equally important&mdash;they're critical for music, among other things.
This applet demonstrates the interference of two longitudinal waves in a tube.

In the applet below, the top two tubes contain two different waves of equal amplitude, wavelength, and frequency.
These two waves are superimposed to create the standing wave in the bottom tube.

Controls and interactivity:

  * Click the ends of the tube to change them from open to closed or vice versa.
  * Move your mouse into a tube to see how much each particle is displaced from its equilibrium point.
    If you mouse over the bottom tube, you can additionally see the nodes (blue) and antinodes (red) created.
  * Click the buttons at the bottom to change the wave parameters.
    Note that the standing wave mode takes on only odd values when the tube is half-open.
