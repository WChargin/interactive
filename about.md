Sometimes, words just aren't enough to explain a concept.
Pictures are a nice addition, and words and pictures together will often suffice.
But some things are just easier to understand with interactive applets.
Sometimes, when you can play with the controls and observe the dynamics of a system, something just clicks.

So I make such applets and put them here.
Have fun.

<strong>Note:</strong>
You need to have JavaScript enabled to view these applets.
JavaScript is enabled by default in most browsers that are newer than sliced bread.
If you've disabled JavaScript, please consider making an exception to enable it on this site.
